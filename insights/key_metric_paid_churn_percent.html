      Subscription video churn is a constant battle in the OTT industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paid Churn Percent is the percentage of your paid subscription base that has left the service in the past 30 days,
      with a comparison to the previous 30 days and year over year with an additional sparkline to see how this compares
      over the last 30 days.
    </p>
    <p>Churn is also broken down into two primary categories; voluntary churn and involuntary churn.</p>
    <p>
      Churn rate isn’t the only metric that you should monitor for the health of your SVoD service but it’s definitely a
      primary metric that deserves a lot of attention. If there is a problem with your streaming service, the churn
      percentage will likely reflect this.

        churn</a>
      is not only for companies that are looking to fix their growth problems, understanding why it happens can also
      help to focus your efforts on the most productive areas. If net subscribers continue growing, you can still use
      this metric to see if you could be growing faster and addressing the cause of churn.
