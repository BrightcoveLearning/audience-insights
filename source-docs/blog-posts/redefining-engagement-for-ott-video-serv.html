<p>Wicket Labs is redefining video engagement with a focus on the audience lifecycle and a bias toward taking action. The key is setting a new engagement status for every registered user, TV-E member, and subscriber based on their video viewing habits.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New</strong> – Users with a view in the last week but none in the last year</li>
<li><strong>Engaged</strong> – Users with multiple views in the last month. Views may not have gaps longer than 28 days from previous views</li>
<li><strong>Recent</strong> – Users with no views in the last week but at least one view in the prior three weeks</li>
<li><strong>Re-engaged</strong> – Users with a view in the last week, but no views in the prior four weeks</li>
<li><strong>Idle</strong> – Users with no views in the last four weeks, but at least one view in the prior eight weeks</li>
<li><strong>Inactive</strong> – Users with no views in the last 12 weeks but at least one view in the last year</li>
</ul>

<p>Once we know where key cohorts of audience members stand, we can better discern their lifecycle with the service and take actions to keep them engaged. Some examples include:</p>
<h3>The Disinterested User</h3>
<p><img class="wp-image-33072 alignnone size-full" src="//m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/disinterested-user.png" alt="chart of engagement by disinterested user" width="1230" height="171" srcset="//m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/disinterested-user.png 1230w, //m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/disinterested-user-980x136.png 980w, //m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/disinterested-user-480x67.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1230px, 100vw"></p>
<p>A disinterested user signs up watches a few videos over the first few weeks, and then their interest began to wane until they became inactive. This is a common pattern for any video service and identifying this cohort as their usage begins to drop is critical to keeping them engaged and avoiding churn.</p>
<p>We recommend a weekly outreach to audience members with a “Recent” status via emails or app notifications. Promoting new hit shows coming into the window as well as hidden gems is a great way to get these users Re-engaged.</p>
<h3>The Spotty Viewer</h3>
<p><img onload="Wpfcll.r(this,true);" src="//m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-fastest-cache-premium/pro/images/blank.gif" class="wp-image-33074 alignnone size-full" data-wpfc-original-src="//m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/spotty-viewing.png" alt="chart of engagement by spotty viewer" width="1192" height="154" data-wpfc-original-srcset="//m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/spotty-viewing.png 1192w, //m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/spotty-viewing-980x127.png 980w, //m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/spotty-viewing-480x62.png 480w" data-wpfc-original-sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1192px, 100vw"></p>
<p>Intermittent viewing can be a healthy usage pattern for your video service. They signed up for the service, explored the catalog for a week or two at the beginning, and then fell into a cycle where they use the service every several weeks.</p>
<p>These audience members may be picked up in your messaging to Recent users or your regular outreach to engaged users.</p>
<h3>Seasonal Viewing</h3>
<p><img onload="Wpfcll.r(this,true);" src="//m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-fastest-cache-premium/pro/images/blank.gif" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-33073 alignnone size-full" data-wpfc-original-src="//m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/seasonal-viewing.png" alt="chart of engagement by seasonal viewer" width="1251" height="214" data-wpfc-original-srcset="//m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/seasonal-viewing.png 1251w, //m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/seasonal-viewing-980x168.png 980w, //m2d8t6y5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/seasonal-viewing-480x82.png 480w" data-wpfc-original-sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1251px, 100vw"></p>
<p>This cohort is best described as a seasonal viewer. They signed up as a subscriber and were highly engaged until they finished all of their favorite show or the sports season ended. When the next season picks up, they re-engaged with the service. Understanding these fans is critical in driving them back to the service as well as marketing other relevant shows or off-season content to extend their viewing past the current season.</p>
<h2>Subscriber Export with Engagement Status</h2>
<p>These three examples provide a glimpse into why we’re redefining engagement to give Wicket Scorecard users a more comprehensive understanding of the level of engagement across their whole subscriber base. Beyond just understanding, we are adding the engagement status to each subscriber as a standard field in our data export. Marketers, editorial teams, and even your sites and apps can react to this data to drive a healthier, long term relationship with each audience member.</p>
