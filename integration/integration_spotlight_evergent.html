    <p>With this integration, we are importing registration, subscription, and payment data from
      Evergent into our customer data platform which we then use to power our Insights
      Scorecard. Every day, Evergent exports the previous 24 hoursâ€™ worth of data as
      multiple CSV files and sends it to a secure Amazon S3 bucket, which we pick up
      automatically.&nbsp;</p>

      If you are using or plan to use Evergent for billing
      and subscriber management, we can easily harmonize data we get from them with content
      metadata, visit &amp; viewing analytics, 3rd party app store data, as well as
      marketing-spend information to provide a complete view of your SVOD service
      performance. We also provide a bridge to downstream marketing tools for CRM and
      campaign management, which makes the insights you see directly
      actionable.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>We have pre-integrated with a broad collection of
      products that span these categories, which you can review</p>
