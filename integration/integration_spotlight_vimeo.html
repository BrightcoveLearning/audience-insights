    <p>With this integration, we are automatically importing Vimeo OTT video metadata, view data, subscriber data, and
      revenue events into our audience insights platform and then harmonizing with data from other sources. We achieve
      this by integrating with Vimeoâ€™s API and pulling data daily.</p>
