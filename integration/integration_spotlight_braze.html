    <p>With this integration, you can automatically sync user records from Audience Insights directly into Braze. With every hashed user ID, Brightcove includes information about tenure, subscription plan, content consumed, devices used, geography of views, engagement status, and more. </p>
    <p>In addition, it's easy to segment users by user attributes like tenure, engagement status, viewing frequency, and content consumption. Segment tags are appended to each user record that matches the segment's criteria. These can be used for performing more targeted automated or ad hoc campaigns.</p>

      If you are using or plan to use Braze for customer campaigns, Brightcove can help to improve this effort. Brightcove provides exports of hashed subscriber IDs that include important context about the user's experience. With the ID, Brightcove appends fields from our customer data platform that leverage our harmonization of subscriber data,  content metadata, visit & viewing analytics, and 3rd party app store data. This data enables specific targeting based on engagement frequency, intensity, content consumed, devices used, etc.
