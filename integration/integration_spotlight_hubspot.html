    <p>With this integration, we are exporting subscriber cohorts from our Scorecard
      directly into HubSpot’s CRM Hub at the click of a link. With every hashed user ID we include information
      about tenure, subscription plan, content consumed, devices used, geography of views,
      engagement status, and more.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>If you are using or plan to use HubSpot for customer
      campaigns, we can easily help to improve this effort by providing exports of hashed
      subscriber IDs that include important context about the user’s experience. With the ID,
      we append fields from our customer data platform that leverage our harmonization of
      subscriber data,&nbsp; content metadata, visit &amp; viewing analytics, and 3rd party
      app store data.&nbsp; This enables really specific targeting, based on engagement
      frequency and intensity, content consumed, devices used, etc.&nbsp; We have
      pre-integrated with a broad collection of products that span these categories, which you
      can review
